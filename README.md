In order to optimize credit card selection for customers, the tool uses Gurobi as its optimization solver. There are 2 inputs to this tool :- the 1st one being the information collected on credit cards such as the benefits, annual fees, interest rates and so on. The 2nd input being user preferences such as their monthly spending habits, income, number of cards they are willing to use and so on. The tool then processes this information and creates an output excel file which contains the optimal credit card choices for the customer, the suggestions on monthly spending to be done on each card, and also changes to the solution based on varying spending habits.
